# Transfer Learning Wildlife

# Project Background
Deep learning models have revolutionized the science of computer vision, with applications ranging from facial recognition, biomedical image processing, and self-driving cars (Voulodimos, Doulamis, Doulamis, & Protopapadakis, 2018). However, an area that has received relatively little attention is wildlife conservation. National scale wildlife conservation programs rely on motion-sensor cameras to collect imagery in remote wilderness regions. These images provide researchers with up-to-date information on the behaviour, distribution and abundance of wildlife. Given the large volume of imagery collected (thousands to millions), it is not feasible for experts or volunteers to manually review them. As such, there is a pressing need to adopt automated computer vision recognition to support this image review process.
The Manaaki Whenua Landcare Research (https://www.landcareresearch.co.nz) is seeking to build a national wildlife monitoring system that benefits from this computer vision technology. Manaaki Whenua Landcare Research is a pioneering conservation and research organisation, receiving support from GroundTruth (https://www.groundtruth.co.nz), World Wildlife Fund NZ (https://www.wwf.org.nz), and the New Zealand government directly. The envisioned system is to comprise a machine learning equipped web service that automatically labels wildlife imagery, which can be easily accessed and shared between a network of authorised community, private and government end users. This information will ultimately serve to guide and inform future conservation efforts.

# Project Aims
To support this endeavour, this project aimed to comprehensively investigate, evaluate, and report on deep learning-based models for the recognition of New Zealand camera trap species. While there exists a number of models to identify wildlife, few have been trained specifically on camera trap imagery, which can often be of poor quality (e.g. blurry, partial views of animals). Fewer still have been built to effectively integrate with client-side machine learning and its associated constraints. This project addresses this need by providing a detailed understanding of the effectiveness of deep learning models for the recognition of camera trap species. Findings shed light on practical constraints, such as model storage size and prediction latency, to inform and guide back-end software development.
